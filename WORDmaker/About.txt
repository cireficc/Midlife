WORDmaker v.01
by Daniel de la Rosa (aka. RadioSpace)

Purpose: 
	To enter data of type Language.Word into an XML file for use by the Midlife Language.ExtendedDictionary. This program is not intended for end users of the application.
	Its intention is for use by the developer of Midlife and its dictionary.

Objective:
    To effeicntly add Language.Word objects to an XML file that will grow to between 50,000 and 100,000 entries. Should also be able to display list of entered words, check for duplicates,
	and later browse the word details in a dialogue box.

v.01: started 2/4/14. Simple UI with collapsable Text boxes this version does not really do anything but allow you to test the UI design.

Key points:

Use TAB and Shift+TAB to move up and down the textboxes. 

Use ENTER to open and close the expanders.

TextBox names should be obvious. If they are not please see table below. If that doesn't help contact radiospace83@gmail.com.

TextBox names for conjugation tables are as follows:
	adj_   = Adjective Table 
	noun_  = Noun Table	
	cp_    = Conditional Present
	cfp_   = Conditional First Past
	csp_   = Conditional Second Past
	ipr_   = Imperative Present
	ipa_   = Imperative Past
	im_    = Indicative Imperfect
	inf_   = Indicative Future
	inpf_  = Indicative Past Future
	inpp_  = Indicative Past Perfect
	inpl_  = Indicative Pluperfect
	inpr_  = Indicative Present
	inprp_ = Indicative Present Perfect
	insp_  = Indicative Simple Past
	infi_  = Infinitive 
	part_  = Participle
	si_    = Subjunctive Imperfect
	spa_   = Subjunctive Past
	spl_   = Subjunctive Pluperfect
	spr_   = Subjunctive Perfect

		Each of these aere followed by the convention used in Dictionary.cs then the word TextBox.
		If you encounter problems please correct or contact radiospace83@gmail.com.
	


v.02: the UI should more closly resemble the XML file structure now

	-I have rearanged the user interface to match the XML schema exactly. however this was a FIRST pass. and will need additional review and correction.
	-found some typos  like using Texbox instead of TextBox in names of TextBoxes.

	once this is refined a little further it will be ready to be used to build a Word object.

	-since Contexts have been added I am  considering a seperate Application for this. to be implemented later, after the dictionary is complete or close to.


	PLANS:  next I may add check boxes to the headers of the Adjective,Noun,Verb sections to indicate if we want to add them to the word.
	this functionality has not been engineered yet.

	I will also add a global text style to make things more readable and increase widths of text boxes.
