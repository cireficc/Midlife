	Its intention is for use by the developer of Midlife and its dictionary.

Objective:
    To effeicntly add Language.Word objects to an XML file that will grow to between 50,000 and 100,000 entries. Should also be able to display list of entered words, check for duplicates,
	and later browse the word details in a dialogue box.

v.01: started 2/4/14. Simple UI with collapsable Text boxes this version does not really do anything but allow you to test the UI design.

Key points:

Use TAB and Shift+TAB to move up and down the textboxes. 

Use ENTER to open and close the expanders.

TextBox names should be obvious. If they are not please see table below. If that doesn't help contact radiospace83@gmail.com.

TextBox names for conjugation tables are as follows:
	adj_   = Adjective Table 
	noun_  = Noun Table
	c_     = Conditional
	cp_    = Conditional Present
	cfp_   = Conditional First Past
	csp_   = Conditional Second Past
	i_     = Imperative
	ipr_   = Imperative Present
	ipa_   = Imperative Past
	in_    = Indicative 
	inf_   = Indicative Future
	inpf_  = Indicative Past Future
	inpp_  = Indicative Past Perfect
	inpl_  = Indicative Pluperfect
